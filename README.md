# CS251-Project-1
Conversation Bot
This project simulates a basic conversation between human and computer.
There is a scanner that reads through a .csv.
The .csv file contains all the corresponding questions and responses. 
This file is stored into a hashmap and accessed through a loop.
At any time, the user may switch to "MATH" mode. 
In this mode, the user can compute basic operations (+,-,*,/).
Exception handeling is ipmlemented to catch arithmetic exceptions.
